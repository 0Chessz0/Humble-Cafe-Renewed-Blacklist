  "shortReason": "Used hate speech, harassed staff, and made inappropriate remarks about consent after being muted.",
  "longReason": "After being muted for using racial slurs, the user continued to harass staff members with offensive language. They directed derogatory comments such as “f***ing whore,” dismissed the concept of consent with statements like “No means yes” and “I don’t need consent,” and used additional slurs. This behavior is highly disruptive, disrespectful, and in direct violation of community guidelines.",
