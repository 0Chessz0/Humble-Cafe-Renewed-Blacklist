  "longReason": "The user repeatedly posted aggressive messages, openly demanding to be banned and making slurs such as \"f**ing little gay people.\" They escalated by issuing veiled threats, including \"send me a link your f**ing IP is mine,\" and pressuring members into DMs with inappropriate questions. This pattern of harassment and intimidation led to an immediate ban to protect the community.",
